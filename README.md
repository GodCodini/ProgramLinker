# ShortcutManager
A little program to start all other programs so you dont need to put them in the taskbar/desktop

This is written in Pascal.
To compile and run, download Lazarus with the Free Pascal Compiler: https://www.lazarus-ide.org/index.php?page=downloads

Clone the repo, open in Lazarus and fill in your program paths. Open the form (F12), click on the dropdown and edit under "items" the Names of the programs. Next go to Start -> Compile and you have a program running.
